            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
            been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
            an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
            and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
            12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        The team was very supportive and kept me motivated “ I started as a
        total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile
        engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve
        made in myself. ”

      <section class="card card-kira">
        Kira Whittle Verified Graduate Such a life-changing experience. Highly
        recommended! “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
        code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
        of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
        and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
        particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
        way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
        certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
        multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”

      <section class="card card-patrick">
        Patrick Abrams Verified Graduate Awesome teaching support from TAs who
        did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning
        from their experiences was easy. “ The staff seem genuinely concerned
        about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me
        the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
        myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
        You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
        community of smart and amazing people. ”
